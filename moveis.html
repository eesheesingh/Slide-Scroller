                <h3>THE</h3><br>
                <h1>SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION</h1>
                <p>A prominent banker is imprisoned in Shawshank for many years after being wrongfully convicted of murder. He is befriended by a convict who knows the ins and outs of prison life and helps him cope with the terrifying realities of prison life.</p>

                <h1>The Dark Knight</h1>
                <p>Set a year after the events of Batman Begins (2005), Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new District Attorney Harvey Dent successfully begin rounding up the criminals who plague Gotham City, until a mysterious and sadistic criminal mastermind known only as "The Joker" appears in Gotham, causing a new wave of chaos. Batman's battle with The Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to "confront everything he believes" and improve his technology in order to defeat him. Bruce Wayne, Dent, and Rachel Dawes form a love triangle.</p>

            <div style="background-color:  #2a86ba;" class="inception__text">
                <h1>Inception</h1>
                <p>Inception, a phenomenally complex story with bankable stars set against the backdrop of the human brain's ability to create and control memories, comes to mind. We begin with Dom Cobb, a mind control merchant played by Leonardo DiCaprio, as he tries to persuade a potential client to hire him. He sets out to assemble a team of experts (including child-star-done-right Joseph Gordon-Levitt and everyone's favourite pregnant teenager Ellen Page) charged with constructing a world inside the mind of Robert Fischer, the heir to a global energy conglomerate played by Cillian Murphy, who is doing his best work since '28 Days Later.'</p>

            <div style="background-color: #000000;" class="matrix__text">
                <h1>The Matrix</h1>
                <p>Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a computer programmer with a side gig as a hacker, who receives mysterious messages that lead him to Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the leader of a motley crew who live aboard a rocket-style craft. It turns out that 1999 is about 100 years in the future. To keep machines "alive," all of humanity has been converted into a source of energy. The Matrix is a massive computer programme that tricks humans into believing they are still living in a destroyed world. Special agents led by Smith (Hugo Weaving) seek out and destroy Morpheus and his followers.</p>

            <div style="background-color: #DAA520;" class="war__text">
                <h1>Avengers:Infinity War</h1>
                <p>Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.</p>
